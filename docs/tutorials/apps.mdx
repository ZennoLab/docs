## How to automate apps

Learn how to install and automate Android Apps. 

In **ZennoDroid** you can configure automation of any actions in a mobile apps.   
We will look at two examples: 
- Installing Youtube on a Memu 9 emulator using **ZennoDroid Pro**.   
- Using already installed Youtube on a real phone in **ZennoDroid Enterprise**.  

All information from the text will be duplicated in the video guides for clarity.

### Installing the application and performing first actions.

> Here we will take a detailed look at how to install Youtube using the Memu 9  
> and put a thumbs up on the first video.
>
> *Summary*:  
> *Open the app market → search by name → install Youtube and open it →*  
> *find the first video on the page and play it → thumbs up*.

#### The detailed algorithm:  

1. To quickly search for an emulated device, click on the **«Installed applications»** button.  
2. Add a search string to the **Action Builder** and type «youtube» in the **Value** field.  
> *The **«Test»** button allows you to quickly run the current action and make sure it works.*  
> *If everything is fine, click **«Add to project»**.*  
3. Change the action type from **«Set»** to **«Rise»**, thus accessing the **«Touch»** event,  
which is responsible for clicking on the screen.  
> *For the **«Open»** action, we add an additional element waiting property and setting the value  
to **30 seconds**. During this time, the script will try to open the application before it returns an error.*  
4. In the application, we examine the first video and find the element responsible for playing it  
(can be determined by matching the video names). Add it to the project and delete all characters except the word **«Play»** from the **«Value»** field. Next to **«Search»** select the value **«0»** and choose **«Rise»**. In the future, this will allow us to include exactly the first video every time, regardless of its title.  
5. Next, let's examine the element responsible for the **Thumbs Up**. Repeat the actions similar to the previous point, but leave only **«You\liked»** in the **«Value»** field.  

### Updating the app on a real phone.  

> Now we will look at how to perform the actions on a real phone, without an emulator. We will update the pre-installed Youtube and put a thumbs up on the first video.  
>
> The principle of operation is similar to the previous example, but with minor differences.

#### The detailed algorithm:

1. Open the app market and find Youtube.  
2. Add an **«Update»** button to the action builder and change the action to **«Rise»**.  
3. Launch the application after the update is complete.  
4. Find the first video and create an action that allows you to select it every time, regardless of the name. 
5. Press the thumbs up button.
