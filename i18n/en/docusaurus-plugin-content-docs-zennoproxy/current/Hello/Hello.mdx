**ZennoProxy** is a modern anonymous proxy service made especially for Zennolab users and anyone working with browser automation. It acts like a “connection string builder”: you pick your parameters (type, country/region, provider) and instantly get a ready-to-use string. It helps you pick, connect, rotate, disconnect, and manage proxies with no extra manual hassle.

### **Who is this tool for?**

* **Marketers and product teams** – lightning-fast geo tests: check prices, banners, redirects, and localization just like a user from a chosen country would see.  
* **Analysts and procurement managers** – monitor availability and prices by country/market, compare price lists.  
* **Developers, QA, and DevOps** – emulate real-world networks and policies: test IP rate limits, CDN behavior, feature flags, and A/B setups by region.  
* **Support** – reproduce regional bugs and collect data for tickets.  
* **Security and OSINT** – careful, lawful collection of public data and geo-based traffic separation.  
* **Private users** – set up traffic routing and service compatibility while traveling or working with region-specific content.

## **What problems does it solve?**

**Geo-testing and product localization**

* Verify prices, currencies, taxes, promos, and redirects for different countries.  
* Visually check banners, translations, and layout tweaks for each locale.  
* Test “first-time experiences” (onboarding) and paywalls by geo.

**SEO, marketing, and data parsing**

* Collect snippets, SERP positions, and competitors in various regions.  
* Scrape product/service details, availability, and prices from marketplaces.  
* Rotate IPs to gather data at scale without getting “stuck” on one address.

**SMM and account operations**

* Split sessions by region for manual or automated workflows.  
* Simulate network conditions to check for platform restrictions.

**QA, development, and DevOps**

* Test rate limits/throttling by IP and retry strategies.  
* Check CDN operations, caching models, geo-routing, and canary/feature-flags.  
* Simulate “live” conditions: different proxy types, static vs. rotating.

**Analytics and procurement**

* Pricing research across retailers/markets, track dynamics and promos.  
* Match assortment and SKU availability by region.

**Security, research, OSINT**

* Segment traffic to keep internal infrastructure hidden while collecting public data.  
* Ensure scanning tools work properly from different regions.

**Everyday networking tasks**

* Set up traffic routing for service compatibility by region.  
* Separate work and personal tasks, boost connection privacy.
