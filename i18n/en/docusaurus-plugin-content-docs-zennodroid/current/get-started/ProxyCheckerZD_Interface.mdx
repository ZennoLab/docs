## Control Panel
This window opens up by default. Here’s where you manage proxy collection and set up each stage.

![Control Panel](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic15.png)
- **Start/Stop**. You use these buttons to start or stop collecting and checking proxies.
- **Filters**. A set of rules applied to proxies after they’re grabbed from the source but before they go into the program’s database.
- **Rules**. These are conditions for picking proxies from the "live" list.
- **Network Monitor**. With this built-in tool, you can test your internet connection for the maximum number of simultaneous threads.
- **Help**. Opens the product manual in your browser.

### Proxy Sources

This is where you set up loading proxies from sources. You can click the globe icon to go straight to the **Sources** tab.
_________________
#### Number of Sources
![Number of Sources](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic17.png)

The top number shows how many active (working) sources there are, the bottom one is the total number.
#### Load Proxies Button
When you click this, proxy collection from the sources will start.

![Load Proxies Button.](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic18.png)

With the gear button, you can choose how many threads will be used to load proxies from the sources.
#### Enable Auto Search
![Enable Auto Search.](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic19.png)
:::warning **This button is only active when proxy loading is enabled.**
:::
After clicking it, ProxyChecker will start searching the internet for proxy sources all by itself. If you click the gear, you can fine-tune the auto search settings.

### Proxy Database

Here’s where you actually start checking proxies. You can click the round cell icon to go to the **Sources** tab.
#### Check Proxies Button
![Check Proxies Button.](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic21.png)

This starts the checking process. Next to it is the familiar gear icon for check settings. Here you can set the number of checking threads and a limit for live proxies — once you hit that, checking stops.

### Live Proxies
![Live Proxies.](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic22.png)

Here you can see the number of live proxies and set the amount of time they’ll keep their live status. You can click the monitor icon to go to the **Proxies** tab.
#### Clear List Button
![Clear List Button](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic23.png)

When you click this, the live proxies list gets cleared according to the set live-time, which you can set by clicking the gear.

### Wizard
![Wizard.](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic25.png)
This helps you add **parsing sources** into the program more easily.
#### What do you want to add?
![What do you want to add?](./assets/ProxyChecker/ProxyCheck_pic26.png)

There are four options:
- **Paste proxies straight into the program.** When you choose this, an empty window opens for you to add proxies.
- **Proxy source.** Here you can specify a **file path** or a **URL (web page)** to collect proxies from.
- **List of proxy sources.** It’s basically the first option, but lets you add several sources at once.
- **Path to a list of proxy sources.** Like option two, but you can enter multiple paths.
