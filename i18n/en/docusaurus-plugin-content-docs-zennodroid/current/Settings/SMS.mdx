## Description
Some sites require you to enter a mobile phone number to confirm your registration, so they can send you a verification code.

That’s where third-party SMS services come in handy. Our goal is to make working with them easy.

## How to connect?

### Secret key
Usually, to use a service, you’ll need what’s called an **API key**. That’s a *unique string of random characters* that lets the service recognize you. For example, it might look like this: `8fc9b30e544885b8480fb590dfcbdd71`.

To get your API key, go to the website of the SMS service you picked and look over their terms. Once you’ve chosen, sign up for the SMS service and get your *API key* from your personal account.

### Additional parameters
Here, you enter the **URL address (domain)** for sending API requests. This is preset in the program by default and **you don’t need to change it unless you have to**. If the URL isn’t filled in, check the documentation for your chosen service.

### Balance
Once you’re logged in to the service, you’ll see your current balance in this field.

:::warning If this field is still empty after you enter your API key, something’s gone wrong.
Possible reasons: wrong key, service issues, or the key has been banned.

### Removing a module
To remove a module you created from the program, **you’ll need to delete two files**:
- `c:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ZennoLab\Configs\ModuleName.dll.config`
- `c:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ZennoLab\CustomModules\Sms\ModuleName.dll`

:::warning We recommend closing ZennoDroid and ProjectMaker before deleting these files.
