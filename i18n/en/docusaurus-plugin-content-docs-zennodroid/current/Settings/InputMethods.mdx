## Input Methods
The program has **4 ways** to input characters from the keyboard.

Different devices handle character input differently, so having several options lets you pick what works best. The first three let you enter any symbols, including emojis; the last one handles only ASCII.

### Details
#### ADBKeyboard
This uses a third-party keyboard that installs automatically when you connect your device. With it, you can type characters as if you were using a virtual keyboard.
#### AccessibilityService
Uses [***UiAutomator2***](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver). Lets you set any value for the field that's currently focused.
Technically, it doesn't input characters—it just changes the field's **Text** property to what you want.
:::tip Keep in mind
*This won't work in apps that don't have a standard element tree. For example, in games.*
:::

#### Native input + Clipboard
Inputs characters via the **IInputManager** and **IClipboard** interfaces. This method is pretty quick.
:::info Note
*Inputting Cyrillic/emojis only works on Android 7 and up. ASCII works on any device.*
:::

#### Input text
Similar to the ***input text*** command, but includes all necessary text conversions so that special characters `< > | ) (` and others get entered correctly. Only supports **ASCII characters**.
:::info Recommendation
*Character-by-character entry is slow, so it's better to choose an input method with **no delay** enabled.*

### What if ADBKeyboard didn't install?
1. You need to install the ***com.android.adbkeyboard.apk*** app on your phone (*the file is in the main program folder*). For example, use the [**Install App**](../Android/ProLite/App#install-an-app) action.
2. On your phone, go to your language input settings and enable ***AdbKeyboard***.
3. Run the [**Start VM**](../Android/ProLite/action#how-do-i-start-or-restart-a-device) action. This activates the keyboard. It'll pop up in any field where you need to enter text—you'll see a small `Adb keyboard ON` notification at the bottom.
