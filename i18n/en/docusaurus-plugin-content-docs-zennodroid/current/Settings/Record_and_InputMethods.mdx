## Project Recording
![Project Recording](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/Record_and_InputMethods_pic2.png)

This tab contains the settings that get activated when project recording is turned on.

![Settings](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/Record_and_InputMethods_pic1.png)
_______________________________________________
## Automatically Insert Directory Macro
:::tip This setting works even *when project recording is off*.
:::

ZennoDroid has [**environment variables**](../pm/Creating/Variables). For example, `{-Project.Directory-}`, which stores the path to the directory where your project file is saved.
:::info If the project isn’t saved to disk, the variable contains an empty string.
:::

When you turn on this setting, ProjectMaker will automatically insert the **project directory macro** wherever possible while creating a project. For example, in other settings or actions. The chosen path should either be in the same folder as the project file, or in one of its subfolders.
_______________________________________________
## Recording Actions by Coordinates
This setting controls whether all clicks inside the [**Emulator Window**](../pm/Interface/DeviceWindow) get recorded along with their coordinates when recording your project. The project will include [**touch emulation actions**](../Android/ProLite/Touch_Emulation) with the click coordinates filled in automatically.
:::warning The emulator’s resolution must be the same when creating and running your project!
:::
_______________________________________________
## Recording Clicks Using Image Search
When you turn on this option, every click inside the [**Emulator Window**](../pm/Interface/DeviceWindow) will be saved to your project as a [**touch action**](../Android/ProLite/RunEvent) using [**Image Search**](../pm/Creating/SearchByPic).
### Color mode
Image search will use one of the following modes by default:
- **RGB**. Search by colored image.
- **Gray**. Grayscale only.
- **Black**. Black and white only.

:::tip Our advice
*To speed up the search, use either **Gray** or **Black** mode*
:::

### Search area
Choose the default area for image search:
- Entire screen
- Selected area of the screen

:::info To reduce CPU load, it’s better to search only in a designated screen area.

## Delay Between Character Inputs
Used in [**Keyboard Emulation**](../Android/ProLite/Keyboard) and [**Set Value**](../Android/ProLite/SetValue) actions as the *default* setting.
_______________________________________________
## Element Waiting Time
Used in [**Set Value**](../Android/ProLite/SetValue), [**Get Value**](../Android/ProLite/GetValue), and [**Run Event**](../Android/ProLite/RunEvent) as the *default* for the field ***“Wait for element no more than (sec)”***.
_______________________________________________
## Element Search Timeout
Used in the [**Image Search**](../pm/Creating/SearchByPic) action as the *default* value for  
***“Wait for element no more than (sec)”***.
_______________________________________________
## Input Methods
The program has **4 ways** to input characters from the keyboard.
![4](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/Record_and_InputMethods_pic3.png)
Different devices handle character input differently, so having several options lets you pick what works best. The first three let you enter any symbols, including emojis; the last one handles only ASCII.

### Details
#### ADBKeyboard
This uses a third-party keyboard that installs automatically when you connect your device. With it, you can type characters as if you were using a virtual keyboard.
#### AccessibilityService
Uses [***UiAutomator2***](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver). Lets you set any value for the field that’s currently focused.
Technically, it doesn’t input characters—it just changes the field’s **Text** property to what you want.
:::tip Keep in mind
*This won’t work in apps that don’t have a standard element tree. For example, in games.*
:::

#### Native input + Clipboard
Inputs characters via the **IInputManager** and **IClipboard** interfaces. This method is pretty quick.
:::info Note
*Inputting Cyrillic/emojis only works on Android 7 and up. ASCII works on any device.*
:::

#### Input text
Similar to the ***input text*** command, but includes all necessary text conversions so that special characters `< > | ) (` and others get entered correctly. Only supports **ASCII characters**.
:::info Recommendation
*Character-by-character entry is slow, so it’s better to choose an input method with **no delay** enabled.*

### What if ADBKeyboard didn’t install?
1. You need to install the ***com.android.adbkeyboard.apk*** app on your phone (*the file is in the main program folder*). For example, use the [**Install App**](../Android/ProLite/App#установка-приложения) action.
2. On your phone, go to your language input settings and enable ***AdbKeyboard***.
3. Run the [**Start VM**](../Android/ProLite/action#как-запустить-или-перезапустить-устройство) action. This activates the keyboard. It’ll pop up in any field where you need to enter text—you’ll see a small `Adb keyboard ON` notification at the bottom.
