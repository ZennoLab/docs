## Project Recording
![Project Recording](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/Record_and_InputMethods_pic2.png)

This tab contains the settings that get activated when project recording is turned on.

![Settings](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/Record_and_InputMethods_pic1.png)
_______________________________________________
## Automatically insert project directory macro
:::tip This setting works even *when project recording is off*.
:::

ZennoDroid has [**environment variables**](../pm/Creating/Variables). For example, `{-Project.Directory-}`, which stores the path to the directory where your project file is saved.
:::info If the project isn't saved to disk, the variable contains an empty string.
:::

When you turn on this setting, ProjectMaker will automatically insert the **project directory macro** wherever possible while creating a project. For example, in other settings or actions. The chosen path should either be in the same folder as the project file, or in one of its subfolders.
_______________________________________________
## Record actions by coordinates
This setting controls whether all clicks inside the [**Emulator Window**](../pm/Interface/DeviceWindow) get recorded along with their coordinates when recording your project. The project will include [**touch emulation actions**](../Android/ProLite/Touch_Emulation) with the click coordinates filled in automatically.
:::warning The emulator's resolution must be the same when creating and running your project!
:::
_______________________________________________
## Click recording through search
When you turn on this option, every click inside the [**Emulator Window**](../pm/Interface/DeviceWindow) will be saved to your project as a [**touch action**](../Android/ProLite/RunEvent) using [**Image Search**](../pm/Creating/SearchByPic).
### Color mode
Image search will use one of the following modes by default:
- **RGB**. Search by colored image.
- **Gray**. Grayscale only.
- **Black**. Black and white only.

| RGB              | Gray | Black (Threshold 140) |
| :----------------: | :------: | :----: |
| ![RGB](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/SearchByPic_pic9.png)        |   ![Gray](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/SearchByPic_pic10.png)   | ![Black](./assets/Record_and_InputMethods/SearchByPic_pic11.png) |
  
:::tip Our advice
*To speed up the search, use either **Gray** or **Black** mode*
:::

### Search area
Choose the default area for image search:
- Entire screen
- Selected area of the screen

:::info To reduce CPU load, it's better to search only in a designated screen area.
