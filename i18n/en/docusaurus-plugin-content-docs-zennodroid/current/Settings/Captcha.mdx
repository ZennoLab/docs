## Description
A **captcha** is an automatically generated test to check whether a user is human or a computer (bot). The simplest ones are usually just distorted text made up of letters and/or numbers. They can appear in different color combinations, with added noise, distortions, lines, or random shapes.

| **Examples of text captchas.**  |  

There are also other types of captchas, where you don‚Äôt just enter characters from a picture, but need to do something more. For example, you might be asked to find buses, palm trees, motorcycles, or other objects; solve a puzzle; arrange things in a certain order; or sort them.

## Why do you need these settings?
ZennoDroid lets you solve text captchas manually. To do this, just pick the `MonkeyEnter.dll` module in the [**Captcha Recognition Action**](../Android/ProLite/CaptchaSolving). But doing this by hand can become a real chore when you have to deal with hundreds or thousands of captchas!

And what if your project runs around the clock and captchas pop up at any given moment?

That‚Äôs when these services come in handy. **They‚Äôre designed to save you from entering captchas manually.**

## How do you connect a service?
![How to connect a service?](./assets/Captcha/Captcha_pic7.png)
### Secret key
Most of the time, you‚Äôll need an **API key** for the service to work. This is a *unique string of random characters* that identifies you to the service. It might look something like this: `8fc9b30e544885b8480fb590dfcbdd71`.

To get an API key, go to the website of a suitable service and check their requirements. Once you‚Äôve chosen a service, sign up and get your *API key* in your account dashboard.

### Login and password
Some services use your login and password (from registration) instead of an API key for authorization.

### Extra parameters
Here, you‚Äôll enter the **URL address (domain)** to send API requests. The program has this filled in by default, and **you shouldn‚Äôt change it unless you have to**. If for some reason the URL isn‚Äôt prefilled, check the service documentation.

### Balance
After you log in, this field will show your current balance.

This field is also used to show error messages (but not for every service).
Possible errors: `IP_BANNED`, `ERROR_WRONG_USER_KEY`, and so on.

:::warning **If this field stays empty after you enter your API key, something went wrong.**
Possible reasons: invalid key (or login/password), service problems, or your key might be banned.
