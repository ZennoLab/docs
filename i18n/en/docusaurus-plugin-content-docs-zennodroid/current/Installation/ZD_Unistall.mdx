4. Now you can choose extra removal options.

- **Remove the entire program directory**  
If you turn this option on, the whole program folder will be deleted, including the log folder and **ExternalAssemblies** (this is where any external dll libraries used in your projects are stored).  
- **Delete user data in AppData**  
Most of the program’s settings are stored at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ZennoLab`. This is where your project and program settings are, as well as your schedules. If you check this option, all these settings will be lost forever.  
:::warning **CAREFUL!**
If you delete the AppData folder, you’ll lose the settings for all program versions, not just the one you’re uninstalling now!

5. Once you’ve chosen the options you want (you don’t have to check anything if you don’t want), click **Continue**.
