## Demo Version Limitations  
- The program only works for 14 days.  
- You can only run 1 thread at a time.  
- Proxy usage is blocked.  
- You have to solve captchas by hand, so you can’t use services for automatic recognition (for example, [CapMonster.Cloud](https://capmonster.cloud/ru/)).  
- If you didn’t log into your account during install, you won’t be able to share projects with other users. Once the Demo is over, all projects will become inaccessible.  
- You can’t use .bat files to launch projects.  
_______________________________________________
### How’s it different from the Lite version?  
Lite is a full-fledged program, and the demo can’t replace it. For example, when you run a project (debug), a 10-minute timer starts counting down the automation’s runtime. Once the timer’s up, you’ll need to enter a captcha manually to keep going. Still, you can test features and create templates without restrictions like that.  
_______________________________________________
### How do you extend the demo?  
When your trial period is up, the program will be paused. You won’t be able to run or create projects. If your demo license expires, you’ll get another shot in 16 days.  
_______________________________________________
### Can you keep working with demo projects after buying a license?  
Yes, but only if you logged in during the demo installation.
