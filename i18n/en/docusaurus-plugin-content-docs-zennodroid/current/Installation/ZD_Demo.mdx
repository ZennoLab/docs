## Demo Version Limitations
- The program only works for 14 days.
- Only 1 thread can be run at a time.
- Proxy usage is blocked.
- Captchas have to be solved manually, you can’t use services for automatic recognition (like [CapMonster.Cloud](https://capmonster.cloud/ru/)).
- If you didn’t log in to your account during installation, you won’t be able to transfer your projects to other users. After the demo expires, all projects will become unavailable.
- You can’t use .bat files to launch projects.
_______________________________________________
### How is this different from the Lite version?
Lite is a full program and the demo can’t replace it. For example, when running a project (or debugging), a 10-minute timer starts counting how long the automation runs. When this time’s up, you’ll need to manually enter a captcha to keep going. But you can test features and write templates without those kinds of limits.
_______________________________________________
### How do you extend the demo period?
When the trial ends, the program will stop working. You won’t be able to launch or create new projects. If your demo license period has expired, you’ll be able to try again after 16 days.
_______________________________________________
### Can you keep working with demo projects after buying a license?
Yes, but only if you logged in during the demo installation.
