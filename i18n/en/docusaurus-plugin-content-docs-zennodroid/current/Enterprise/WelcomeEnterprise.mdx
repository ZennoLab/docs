ZennoDroid Enterprise is the most powerful solution for corporate needs. The main difference from other versions is that it works **with real physical Android devices**, which gives you the fastest job execution and total compatibility with any app.

:::tip You can also use the BlueStacks emulator for tasks that require virtualization.
:::

The Enterprise version supports unlimited multithreading. The license lets you link up to three computers, with only one allowed to be used at a time—giving you just the flexibility you need in a corporate environment.
