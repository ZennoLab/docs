_______________________________________________
This action brings together a variety of functions that can be useful when working on a project.

## How do you add utilities to a project?
***Right-click → Add Action → Android → Utilities***

## Available Utilities
### Console Command (ADB Shell)
![ADB shell](../assets/Utilities/Utilities_pic2.png)
:::danger This action is not an ADB command in the strict sense.
Think of it more like a console or emulator terminal. All commands should be entered without "ADB Shell" at the start.
:::

This utility works similarly to the [**Terminal Emulator for Android**](https://apkpure.com/terminal-emulator-for-android/jackpal.androidterm) app. It lets you execute Linux console commands built into Android.

There's a 10-second timeout for this action. If your command doesn't finish in that time, the action will end with an error (exit on the red branch).

Example commands:
- **`ls -la /sdcard/Download`** — list all files and folders at *`/sdcard/Download`*.
- **`pm list packages`** — all installed apps.
- **`pm list packages -3`** — only third-party apps.
![Command example](../assets/Utilities/Utilities_pic3.png)
#### Save result to variable
Here you'll need to specify an existing or new variable to store the output.

#### Sending/receiving files and folders
This utility also lets you run commands to send and receive files to/from the device:
- Send a folder: *`adb push`* **`"c:\MyFolder"`**   **`/sdcard/`**
- Send a file: *`adb push`* **`"{-Project.Directory-}myFile.txt"`** **`/sdcard/myFileNewName.txt`**
- Get a folder: *`adb pull`* **`/sdcard/myFolder`** **`c:\Users\Public`**
- Get a file: *`adb pull`* **`/sdcard/myFile.txt`** **`"{-Project.Directory-}myFileNewName.txt"`**
:::tip The first path in the command is *where you're getting the file from*, the second is *where you're sending it to*.

#### Some useful attributes you can get from an element:
- coordinates and size (the **`bounds`** attribute)
- displayed text (the **`text`** or **`content-desc`** attribute)
- element's unique id (the **`resource-id`** attribute)
