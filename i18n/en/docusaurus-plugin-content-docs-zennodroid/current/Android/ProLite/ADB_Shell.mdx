## ADB Shell  
This is the command line interface for interacting with Android devices. With it, you can run various commands to control your smartphone, test apps, and analyze how they work.

### How do you add it to a project?
#### Through the context menu:  
**Add Action → Android → Utilities**

![How to add to project](../assets/ADB_Shell/ADB_Shell_pic1.png)

This action lets you run built-in Android console Linux commands.

You can always look up detailed info online. Since all these commands are basic Linux commands, there’s a ton of guides and explanations for them.

## Special Commands
### Activity Manager `am`
This is an Android system command for managing apps, their states, and interacting with system components. It's useful for developers and testers, since it lets you automate different actions on the device.

In Android, apps are made up of components, the main ones being **Activity** and **Intent**. These are related concepts that play a big role in app architecture.

#### Activity
This is a component of an Android app that represents a single screen of the user interface. Like a page in a browser or a window in an app. Usually, Activity windows take up the whole available screen. Each Activity works independently but can interact with other Activities, both within the same app and across different apps.

**Example Activities in an email app:**  
- Inbox Activity (list of incoming emails)  
- Email Activity (reading a particular email)  
- Compose Activity (writing an email)  
- Settings Activity (app settings)  

:::info  **Call Examples**
- **Launch file manager:**  
`am start com.cyanogenmod.filemanager/com.cyanogenmod.filemanager.activities.NavigationActivity`  
- **Open settings:** `am start -n com.android.settings/.Settings`  
- **Launch browser:** `am start -n com.android.browser/.BrowserActivity`
:::

#### Intent
This is an object that tells the system what needs to be “done” (for example, open a URL, send an email to a specific address, call a phone number, or take a photo). In the web, you use a URL (link) to go to another page; in Android, you use intents to launch apps or other Activities. An app can create such an intent and send it to the system, and the system decides which activity (or other component) will handle it.

:::info  **Call Examples**
- **Open URL:** `am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d https://zennolab.com`  
- **Search via the browser (browser must already be running):**  
`am start -a android.intent.action.WEB_SEARCH -n com.android.browser/.BrowserActivity --es query 'Hello, world!'`  
::: 

### Package Manager `pm`
This command is for managing installed apps and packages. With it, you can delete data, enable or disable an app, get a list of installed apps, and so on. The **`pm`** command is especially useful for automating app testing and managing devices that don’t have a graphical interface.

:::info  **Call Examples**
- **Uninstall an app:** `pm uninstall com.example.MyApp`    
- **Get a list of all apps:** `pm list packages`  
You can also get this list using the [**Installed Apps**](../../Tools/Installed_App) tool.
