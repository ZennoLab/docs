### What to look for (Regex)
Type in the text you want to find. The field supports [**regular expressions**](../../Tools/RegEx_Tester).

### Where to look
Choose the data you want to search in:
- **Source**  
The full structure of elements on the screen. It's the same as what you get in the action [**Get element structure (XML)**](./Utilities#get-ui-structure-xml).
- **Text**  
An array of strings that contains text displayed on the screen, meaning the values of the `text` and `content-desc` attributes.

### Wait before execution
Set the number of seconds for the action to wait before it starts.
