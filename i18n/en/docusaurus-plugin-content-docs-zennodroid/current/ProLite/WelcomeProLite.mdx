### ZennoDroid Lite.
This is the basic version, perfect if you want to get to know the platform and solve **simple automation tasks**. It works exclusively with virtual Android devices through **MEmu and LDPlayer Android emulators**.

The Lite version includes all the essential tools to create automation scripts, but its features are limited. Everything runs **in single-threaded mode**, making it a good fit for learning the platform and handling small projects. You can **install the license on just one computer**, but it’s a great choice for beginners, students, or anyone just starting to explore mobile app automation.

### ZennoDroid Pro.
A professional solution built for serious commercial projects. Like the Lite version, Pro works with virtual devices via **MEmu and LDPlayer emulators**. Here, you get advanced scripting tools, support for complex algorithms and conditional logic, and the ability to integrate with external services and databases.

The Pro version’s main advantage is **unlimited multithreaded operation**, which lets you run lots of tasks at once and massively boosts productivity. The license lets you **install it on up to three computers**, giving you plenty of flexibility at work.

:::tip You can still only run it on one machine at the same time.

The Pro version is great for any size business where you need to automate complicated processes. Marketers use it to manage social networks, analysts gather competitor intel, and developers use it for thorough app testing.
