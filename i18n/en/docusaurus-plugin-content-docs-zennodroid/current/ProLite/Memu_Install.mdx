## What is Memu?
Memu is an Android emulator that lets you install, use, and delete any apps, just like you would on a real device. It's packed with features like smart controls, instance creation, key-mapping for macros, controller support, game and app automation, screen recording, GPS spoofing, and even command line support.

From Android's point of view, MEmu fully emulates a device’s work: processor, memory, screen orientation, ROM, SD card, WiFi, battery, camera, GPS, accelerometer, and so on. All this is simulated by software.

As far as Windows is concerned, it’s just another app, like Notepad. All the data from the virtual Android device is stored in a few files in a specific Windows folder. For example, the SD card’s contents are likely just a 10GB file.
