### Multiple transitions to GoodEnd.
When debugging, the project goes into *GoodEnd* by default just once. After that, you’ll need to restart the project using the **From the Start** button.
If you want to go into *GoodEnd* several times in a row, turn on the [**Go to Bad/GoodEnd when debugging multiple times**](../../Settings/Debugging) option in *Settings*.
