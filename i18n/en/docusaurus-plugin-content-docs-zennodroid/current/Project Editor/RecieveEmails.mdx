### How to search for an email
![How to search for an email](./assets/RecieveEmails/RecieveEmails_pic5.png)

#### Imap folders
![Imap folders](./assets/RecieveEmails/RecieveEmails_pic6.png)

Here you can pick which mailbox folders the emails will be searched in.

![button](./assets/RecieveEmails/RecieveEmails_pic7.png)  This button refreshes the list of available folders.

#### Reg. expr. (Regular Expression)
Type in a regular expression here to filter the emails you want in the mailbox.

#### Mail fetch intervals
Emails from services can come with a delay. So you can set the interval in seconds and how many times to try downloading the list of emails.

The divider `;` shows the number of attempts. For instance, in the screenshot it’s: *first try after 15 sec, second - 30 sec, third - 60 sec*.

#### Download no more than X emails from folder
Set the number of emails to be downloaded.

#### Delete found email
If on, the found email will be deleted from the mailbox after it’s processed.
_______________________________________________
### Search text in email
![Search text in email](./assets/RecieveEmails/RecieveEmails_pic8.png)

You can save the results of a few different regular expressions at once!

For example, in the email you might have:
- activation code,
- website address,
- phone number,
- name and surname.
You can pull all this out in one go! Just write a regex for each item and add variables to save the results into.

#### Regular Expression
Write the regex for finding the text you need.

#### Match #
Often a single regex may have more than one match. Here you’ll see the zero-based number of the found item. ***Counting starts at zero***.

:::warning **We recommend not relying on the match number.**
The project structure can change, so can the order of links.
Try to write your regex so that it only matches one result.
:::

#### Save to variable
In this column, pick an existing variable or create a new one – this is where the regex result will be stored.
_______________________________________________
### Save error to variable
![Save error to variable](./assets/RecieveEmails/RecieveEmails_pic9.png)

- ***Without authorization***  `socks5://ip:port` or `http://ip:port`
- ***Without protocol*** *(defaults to http://)*  `login:password@ip:port` or `ip:port`

:::tip **You can use variables here.**
:::

#### Custom

:::tip **You can use variables in any field.**

:::info **If you don’t specify a protocol for the proxy, http:// will be used by default**

## Example
Let’s say that after registering in an app, you need to confirm your account by clicking the link in the email.

![Example](./assets/RecieveEmails/RecieveEmails_pic13.png)

1. Sign up in the app.
2. Add the **Receive Mail** action to your project and set it up.
3. Get the activation email.
4. Click the link.
5. Account is successfully confirmed.

This is especially handy when automating things in apps, since not using a separate mail client saves time and resources.
