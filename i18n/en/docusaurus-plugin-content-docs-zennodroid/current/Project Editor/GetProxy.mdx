### Pick by rule.
A few options are available:
- **No rules**
- **Anonymous/Anonymous (HTTPS)**
- **Google passed with Captcha**
- **Google passed**
- **Elite/Elite (HTTPS)**
- **Socks**

You need to edit these rules in Proxychecker.

If you choose ***No rules***, proxies will be taken in order.

And the option **Remove proxy from live list** deletes the proxy server from the list after you take it.

You can also **Put the received proxy into a variable**.
On the screenshot above, it's `{-Variable.taken_proxy-}`.
