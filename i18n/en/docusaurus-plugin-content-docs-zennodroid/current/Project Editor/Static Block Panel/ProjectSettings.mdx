With these settings, you can set values that will be automatically applied when the template is launched.

## How to open the settings?
To open **Project Settings**, you need to click the corresponding button in the ***Static Blocks Panel***.

## Available options.
### Android.

Here, you can set up the **Pause between actions**, which will be triggered before the action. After you change it, you need to start the project **From the beginning** using the special button in the top panel.

Here are the actions affected by this option:
- [**Get value**](../../Android/ProLite/GetValue)
- [**Set value**](../../Android/ProLite/SetValue)
- [**Run event**](../../Android/ProLite/RunEvent)
- [**Touch emulation**](../../Android/ProLite/Touch_Emulation)
- [**Swipe emulation**](../../Android/ProLite/Swipe)
- [**Keyboard emulation**](../../Android/ProLite/Keyboard)

Keep in mind some of these actions also have their own pause settings. So, in the end, these two settings will add up — first, the pause from the project settings will run, then the one from the action settings.

Here, you can choose the rule for how proxies will be picked when the project starts. The rule for the [**Proxychecker**](../../get-started/ProxyCheckerZD) itself can be changed using the [**Get proxy**](../GetProxy) action.

### HTTP settings.
![Search](./assets/ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings_pic5.png)

In this tab, you set the way HTTP requests are sent:
- **Default**. The method picked in the *program settings in the "Execution" tab*.
- **Standard method**. The Chilkat library will be used.
- **Alternative method**. *ZennoHttpClient* will be used, which lets you fix issues with certain sites.

These settings are used for request actions. You can read more about how they work in these articles: [**GET request**](../../Project%20Editor/HTTP%20and%20FTP/GET), [**POST request**](../../Project%20Editor/HTTP%20and%20FTP/POST), and [**HTTP requests**](../../Project%20Editor/HTTP%20and%20FTP/HTTP).
