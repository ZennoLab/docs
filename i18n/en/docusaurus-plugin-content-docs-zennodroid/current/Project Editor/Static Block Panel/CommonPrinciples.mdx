## What are static blocks?  
![Search](./assets/CommonPrinciples/CommonPrinciples_pic1.png)  

Every project has a special field at the bottom — the static blocks panel. These are elements that belong to the entire project and are available from anywhere in it. Unlike actions (cubes), which run one after the other over time.  

Each static block is responsible for one or several project properties. Things like project settings, profile settings, encryption, as well as lists and tables with data.  

When you create a project, it already has several required static blocks that you can't delete.
