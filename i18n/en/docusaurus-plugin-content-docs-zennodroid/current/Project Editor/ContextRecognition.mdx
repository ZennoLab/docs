## Usage example.
Let's say you need to parse the text from a website's main page and identify at least three topics.

![Usage example](./assets/ContextRecognition/ContextRecognition_pic3.png)

1. Parse the main article into the `text` variable.
2. Set a low relevance percent (10%) because the site has a lot of different topics.
3. Put the result in the `tematiki` variable.

## Pro tip.
The **Context Recognition** action is popular among SEO specialists. One of the most common uses is to identify website topics for placing advertising links.

If you post links to your product on every possible site, there's a high risk you'll get banned by search engines. So, it's best to check the page topics first, before posting your links. If the text doesn't match the focus of your site, just skip it.

Then, when you need to advertise your site, you simply use links for posting not from a general pool, but from one sorted by topic ahead of time. For example, you can post a car insurance article in a car blog, not one where they review movies.

That way, your chances of passing moderation go way up. This is especially important on large and reputable sites.

You can also use this method to check links that have been posted on your own site.
