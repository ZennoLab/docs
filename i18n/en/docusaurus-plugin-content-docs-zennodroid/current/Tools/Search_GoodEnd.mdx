## Working with the window  
### Let’s take a closer look

*1*. Quick search bar for finding the right action.  
*2*. A list of actions that can lead to the successful completion of your project.

If you double-click on one of the actions, the project view will jump right to it.

:::tip **The search only finds a function if it’s used inside an action.**

### How can you use this?  
Sometimes you might accidentally forget to connect two actions with logic arrows. When that happens, your project ends up finishing early with a success, after only doing part of what you wanted—it won’t throw any errors, though.

#### Example of early completion

In the project shown, it will finish successfully on the **click** action, because it’s not connected to any other actions.

If your project has 10 blocks or fewer, this isn’t a big deal. But searching for this kind of break by hand in big templates can take forever.

### Example workflow  
1. Open up the **Find Successful Exits** window.  
2. Compare the list of successful completions with the logic you’d planned.  
3. Fix your template if needed.

So if you made a mistake somewhere, this tool will help you spot any trouble spots.
