You can copy an app’s identifier to the clipboard and use it with the [**App Actions**](../Android/ProLite/App) feature to launch, stop, or uninstall apps. You can also use it to back up and restore app data. All these actions will be saved to your project.

:::tip **You can get a list of apps using [adb shell](../Android/ProLite/ADB_Shell#adb-shell).**
The command is `pm list packages`
