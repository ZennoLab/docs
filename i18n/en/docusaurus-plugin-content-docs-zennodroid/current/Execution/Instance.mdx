- **Gray** — Preparing;
- **Blue** — Execution;
- **Orange** — Waiting for actions;
- **Red** — Errors;
- **Green** — Done.

#### Filtering by status
You can also filter instances by their current status:

### Waiting for user actions
Windows in **Waiting for user actions** mode will also appear on your computer's taskbar. You can minimize or maximize them as needed. When the instance's input timeout runs out, it'll disappear from the taskbar.
