## What is a Profile and what's it for?  
A **Profile** is a virtual identity that **ProjectMaker** generates. You can set up its browser, OS, platform, nationality, gender, age, emulated data, and more.

![What is a Profile](./assets/Work_with_Profile/Work_with_Profile_pic2.png) 

This feature is useful while creating or debugging a project to check how it runs with different datasets. You can quickly generate a profile with new data, or load another one from a file.  
:::info **When you save or load a profile, the browser's cookies and cache are saved/transferred as well.**

## Working with a Profile.  
### Loading, saving, and generating.  
![Loading, saving, and generating](./assets/Work_with_Profile/Work_with_Profile_pic3.png)  

**1. Load.** Lets you load a previously saved profile. After clicking the button, a standard file selection window opens.  
**2. Save.** Saves the current profile to the path you choose.  
**3. Regenerate.** Fully updates all profile parameters.  
:::tip ***You can do it like this, too.***

### "Person" Tab.

## Accessing profile data through variables.  
### Using the Variables window.  
![Variables window.](./assets/Work_with_Profile/Work_with_Profile_pic10.png)  

In the Variables window, in the **Environment (1)** tab, you'll find a list of variables that are handy for working with Profiles. They'll start with `Profile`. You can also **copy the macro (2)** for a selected variable right here.
_______________________________________________ 
### Manually.
In any field that supports variable macros (for example, in the [**Notification**](../../Project%20Editor/Logic/Notification) action), press `Ctrl+Space`. Find `{}Profile` and click on it. Then type a dot to bring up another dropdown with all the profile variables. Double-click any variable you need and it'll insert automatically.
