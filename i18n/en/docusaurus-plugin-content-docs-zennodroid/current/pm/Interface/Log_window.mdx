## What is the Log and what is it for?  
![Log](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic1.png)  

The log is used to display notifications to the user. There are three types:  
- **Informational ( ¬° )**  
For example: `Starting work`, `Beginning registration`, `Account created successfully`,  
- **Warning ( ‚ùï )**  
Any non-critical errors that don't affect how the template works.  
- **Error ( ‚ùå )**  
These let you know that something serious has happened, and you really need to pay attention.  

The log is especially useful for tracking errors in the template, for example, ones that could slow down its execution.  

:::info **Notifications are sent to the log using the Notification action.**
 You can also uncheck **Show in ZennoDroid** so messages only show in ProjectMaker.

## Enabling the log  
**Top menu ‚Üí Window ‚Üí Log:**  

![Enabling](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic3.png) 

<details>
<summary>**The Log isn't showing up for me. What do I do?**</summary>
<!--All you need is a blank line-->

    Sometimes the log window just doesn't appear even though it's enabled. If it still won't show up after several tries, it's best to do a full **window settings reset** in ProjectMaker.

    **WARNING**: *The following steps will reset your window layout. If you've set up the interface to your own liking, all those settings will be wiped and things will go back to default.*

    Go to **Edit ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí at the very bottom, Reset panels. Then restart ProjectMaker. All settings will be reset, and the Log will work again.

    You can use this method for issues with other windows, too.

![Context menu](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic11.png) 

- **Show action** Focuses on the action that sent the selected message.  
- **Copy action Id** The unique action number will be copied. You can use it to search in the project. It looks like this: `3e6988d1-9518-4535-a6d2-f0a33420c730`.   
- **Copy message** The entire message text gets saved to the clipboard.

## Features for experienced users  
### Log file on your computer  
PM and ZD also save all logs on your computer in the program folder.  
Here's how the path looks: `C:\Program Files\ZennoLab\RU\ZennoDroid Pro\2.3.8.0\Progs\Logs`  

By default, all project logs are written to one file. You can change this with some C# code at the start of your template:
```js 
// Send the log for this template to a separate file.
project.LogOptions.LogFile = @"D:\log.txt";
// Each thread will get its own log file.
// The file names (in our case, log) will have the thread id added to them.
project.LogOptions.SplitLogByThread = true;  
```  
_______________________________________________ 
## Advanced log window  
Turn on via *Edit ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí*  ***Advanced log window***.

![Advanced log](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic12.png) 

You need to restart ProjectMaker for the changes to apply.
:::info **This setting will turn on for ZennoDroid too.**

_______________________________________________   
### Headers  
![Headers](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic13.png)  

- Type of message  
- Time  
- *Unnamed header*  
- Message  
If you click any of the headers, you can sort the messages by it.
_______________________________________________ 
### Message filters  
When you hover the mouse over any header, a filter icon appears.

![Message filter](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic14.png) 

- **Time filters**  
There are lots of options for fine-tuning the filter (by weekday, between two dates, up to a specific day, and so on).

![Time filters](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic15.png) ![Log](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic16.png) ![Log](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic17.png)

- **Text filters**  
Available for the Unnamed column and Message text.

<details>
<summary>**A quick guide to the filters**</summary>
<!--All you need is a blank line-->

    **`Equals`** ‚Äî the string matches the filter (exact match),  
    **`Does Not Equal`** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt match the filter,  
    **`Begins With`** ‚Äî starts with...,  
    **`Ends With`** ‚Äî ends with...,  
    **`Contains`** ‚Äî contains...,  
    **`Does Not Contain`** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt contain...,  
    **`Is Blank`** ‚Äî string is empty,  
    **`Is Not Blank`** ‚Äî isn‚Äôt empty,  
    **`Custom`** ‚Äî custom filter.
</details>

### Header context menu  
![Header context menu](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic20.png)  

If you right-click a header, a context menu pops up with more features: *group by column*, *hide columns*, *auto fit width*.
But the most interesting are: ***Auto-filter*** and ***Filter builder***.
_______________________________________________ 
### Auto-filter  
<details>
<summary>**Right-click a header and select *Show auto-filter row* at the very bottom.**</summary>
<!--All you need is a blank line-->

    ![Auto-filter](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic21.png) 
</details>   

When you turn this on, you'll see an extra row under the headers. Now you can make a filter with your own logic.

![extra row](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic22.png) 

On the left of each row there‚Äôs an icon‚Äîif you click it, you get to pick the filter type.
The filter types and input values depend on the column kind. For *Time* these are comparison operators and dates, for *Message* it‚Äôs text search instead of dates.

### Filter builder

Let‚Äôs break down the available buttons.

![available buttons](./assets/Log_Window/Log_window_pic24.png)  

**1.** Condition management button: lets you add a new condition or group, or remove all conditions.  
Available options:  
    - ***AND*** ‚Äî must satisfy ALL conditions  
    - ***OR*** ‚Äî must satisfy at least one  
    - ***NOT AND*** ‚Äî does NOT satisfy ALL  
    - ***NOT OR*** ‚Äî does NOT satisfy at least one  

**2.** This button adds another condition.  
**3.** üü¶ The blue text in square brackets shows which column the filter applies to.  
:::tip ***Unnamed column***  
*In the screenshot, it's last. It has no name, but you can filter by it anyway.*
:::
**4.** üü© Filter type is in green.  
**5.** ‚¨õ Black text ‚Äî the filter data you enter.  
**6.** This button easily deletes the filter.

## More on the Unnamed column
### How do you fill it in?  
For this, you‚Äôll need to use the [**Custom C# code**](../../Project%20Editor/CustomCode/–°) block and basic C# code knowledge. You can‚Äôt write to this column using the standard *Notification* action.

There are four methods for outputting messages to the log:  
- ***`project.SendInfoToLog`*** ‚Äî sends info messages  
- ***`project.SendWarningToLog`*** ‚Äî for non-critical error notices  
- ***`project.SendErrorToLog`*** ‚Äî error that needs attention  
- ***`project.SendToLog`*** ‚Äî lets you set the message color  

#### First option:  
```js 
// Arguments:
// 1st - string that goes in the "Message" column
// 2nd - bool, if the message should be logged in ZennoPoster
project.SendInfoToLog("Message", true);  
```
#### Second option: 
```js
// Arguments:
// 1st - string for the "Message" column
// 2nd - string, this will show up in the unnamed column.
// 3rd - bool, if the message should be logged in ZennoPoster
project.SendInfoToLog("Message", "Way", true);
```
#### Result:

### Why use the Unnamed column?  
- With multi-threaded work, you can put the account name here, and in *Message*, what that account is currently doing. Then you can group or filter notifications by this column as needed.  
- In big projects, you could use it to show which part of the template is currently running, and put the specific action in *Message*. For example, during registration, profile completion, product search, parsing and processing, publishing the processed data‚Äîall within one project.
