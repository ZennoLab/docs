## How do you use this window?  
### What can you do with it?    
- Find an action by name or by its function.  
- Add an action to your project.  
- Quickly transfer actions with a double click. 
### Search by name and add to the project.

![Search by name](./assets/Work_with_Action/Work_with_Action_pic4.png)  

Type in a rough name → Pick the action you need → Add it to your project with a double click or by dragging it in.  

You can also search not by name, but by a specific function. In this case, the action will be created right away with the chosen function:

## Another way to add an action.  
You can add any action to your project by right-clicking on any empty spot on the project canvas and choosing **Add action**.
