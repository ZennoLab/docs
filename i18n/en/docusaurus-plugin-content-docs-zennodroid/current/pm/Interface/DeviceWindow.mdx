## Getting Started
In this window, you can interact with both the emulator and a real device.  
When you launch ProjectMaker, the device window will look like this:  

![Getting Started.](./assets/DeviceWindow/DeviceWindow_pic1.png)

To get started, you need to click **Run Device**. If **Recording** is enabled for the project, two actions will be added to the actions canvas: **Select Device** and **Start/restart Device**.
_______________________________________________
## Window Components
This is what the window looks like after a successful device launch:  

![Window Components.](./assets/DeviceWindow/DeviceWindow_pic2.png)

Here, you can interact with the device directly: click, swipe, open apps—everything you do will be reflected. And if recording is enabled, these actions will also show up on the canvas as corresponding actions.
