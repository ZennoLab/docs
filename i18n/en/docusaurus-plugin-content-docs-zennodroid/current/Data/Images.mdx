- save screenshots from the app.  
_______________________________________________ 
## How to add it to your project  
Right-click the context menu: **Add action → Data → Image Processing**.

_______________________________________________
## Processing  
### No processing  
The image won’t be modified in any way. This option is useful for saving screenshots or pictures from the internet as they are.  
_______________________________________________
### Resize  
Lets you change the size of your image. Available options:  
- **Width and Height**: Enter values for these parameters.  
- **Dimensions**: Sets whether the numbers above are *Percentages* of the original size or actual *Pixels*.  
- **Keep aspect ratio**: If you pick this, **Width** and **Height** will always stay in the original proportion, so you can't set them independently.  
- **Do not enlarge image**: If the **Width** and **Height** you set are bigger than the original, resizing won’t be applied.  
_______________________________________________
### Crop  
This lets you crop the image. Options:  
- **Area**: Choose what to crop.  
    - *Visible*: Only for **Instance Screenshot**. Crops the screenshot to the app’s open window. You get only the visible part.  
    - *Custom*: Crop the image based on the parameters set below.  
- **Left / Top / Width / Height**: Choose values in pixels or percent (pick below).   
- **Dimensions**: Sets the above type as either *Percent* of the original or *Pixels*.  
_______________________________________________
### Rotate

## Usage Example  
Let’s say you made a template, but at some stage, it fails with an error. To help figure out why, you can take a screenshot at the moment of the error and take a look at what’s going on.

Create an action [**Random**](./Random) and generate a random number or name for the *thread*. Save this to a variable `{-Variable.thread-}`.

Now add a [**BadEnd**](../Project%20Editor/Logic/BadEnd) action and link it to **Image Processing**. Set the options like you see in this screenshot:

![Add to project](./assets/Images/Images_pic6.png)  

**File path:** `{-Project.Directory-}{-Variable.thread-}\App_screenshot.jpg`.

You can also save the page code `{-Page.Dom-}` using the [**Write to file**](../Android/ProLite/Files) action. This helps troubleshoot bugs that come up while working with the browser.
